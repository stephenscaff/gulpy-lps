# A Gulp Workflow Landing Page Project Starter.


Just a little starter for dealing with multiple static projects, needing specific and common assets, within the same Gulp Project. A `Common` directory houses reuseable HBS partials and resueable js libs. All other assets are housed within their respective subdirectories (ie; `/lp-1`, `/lp-2`, etc).

Just dupe `lp-1`, to `lp-2` and so on.

Also inlcudes a simple, lightweight server via `gulp-live-server`.

### Run

Just run `gulp` from the project. Everything builds out to a `dist` folder.
